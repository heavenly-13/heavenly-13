#  About Me
I bring a balanced blend of skills to the table, rooted in meticulous organization and effective communication. With a background in quality assurance testing, I've honed my ability to ensure top-notch quality while also excelling in problem-solving and interpersonal communication.

During my three years as a QA Technician at Creative Assembly, I developed a keen eye for detail and a strong analytical mindset. My past position, along with my engagement in freelancing, solidified my expertise, where I contributed to testing other video games and applications and gained proficiency in various tools and techniques.

Now, as I transition into a Reporting Specialist role, I'm eager to apply my research and analytical skills to provide valuable insights and drive informed decision-making. Currently, I'm intensively studying reporting techniques and tools while actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in practical settings. This marks a significant step towards my career goal of expanding my role and impact within the software testing industry.

In my free time, I am an avid enthusiast of various activities that fuel my passion for creativity and exploration. I immerse myself in video game modding, where I enjoy tinkering with game mechanics and creating unique experiences. Additionally, I actively contribute to internet archiving efforts, preserving digital content for future generations. My love for gaming extends beyond modding and archiving; I also engage in video game speedruns, constantly pushing the boundaries of gameplay and strategy. Moreover, I have a keen interest in streaming, where I sometimes share my gaming experiences and interact with a community of like-minded individuals.

Alongside my gaming pursuits, I indulge in the realms of art and criticism, appreciating the nuances of flow, composition and storytelling. Furthermore, I enjoy moderating and helping online communities, fostering engaging discussions and ensuring a positive and inclusive environment for fellow enthusiasts. I've also taken on managerial and administrational positions in various community servers.

These diverse interests not only enrich my personal life but also inform and inspire my approach to problem-solving and creativity in my professional endeavors.
